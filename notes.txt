# Notes for Loan Default Analysis Project

## Observations
1. Columns with 100% missing values were dropped automatically during data cleaning.
2. Data cleaning included:
   - Handling missing values for key columns like `annual_inc`, `emp_length`, and `loan_amnt`.
   - Dropping irrelevant columns such as `next_pymnt_d`, `mths_since_last_major_derog`.
3. Visualizations were used to identify correlations between loan defaults and:
   - Loan grade (A-G)
   - Debt-to-income ratio
   - Employment length

## Further Improvements
- Include more robust imputation techniques for missing values (e.g., mean, median, or predictive methods).
- Perform feature engineering to create new metrics from existing data.

## Recommendations for Future Use
- Automate missing data handling for similar datasets.
- Use machine learning models for predicting loan default using cleaned data.
